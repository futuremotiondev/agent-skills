# Output Specification

## Markdown report

Emit as a `.md` file when `report` is in `outputs`. Section order is fixed.

### 1. Run header — 4 lines max

Topic, resolved arguments, counts (candidates found / verified / cataloged / dropped), timestamp.

### 2. Ranked catalog table — FIRST, always

Immediately after the header. Not after methodology, not after a summary paragraph. This is the
deliverable; everything else is support.

```markdown
| # | Name | Type | Score | Authority | Fit | Stars | Updated | Flags | Source |
|---|------|------|-------|-----------|-----|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | ... | Skill | 84 | Vendor | Purpose-built | 3.1k | 2026-07 | — | [repo](url) |
| 2 | ... | Plugin | 71 | Community-vetted | Strong | 890 | 2026-05 | `mcp` `hooks` | [repo](url) |
```

- `Type`: `Skill` · `Plugin` · `Marketplace` · `Skill Pack`
- `Score`: composite only here; full breakdown goes in the per-entry section
- `Stars`: fetched this run, or blank. Never a guess.
- `Flags`: supply-chain flags from `verification.md`, or `—`
- Sort by score descending. Cap at `max_results`; overflow to §6.

### 3. Coverage summary by facet

One row per facet from step 2 of the workflow, **including the empty ones**.

```markdown
| Facet | Coverage | Best option | Score |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------|
| <facet> | Covered | <name> | 84 |
| <facet> | Partial | <name> (incidental) | 58 |
| <facet> | Uncovered | — | — |
```

### 4. Per-entry detail

For each cataloged entry, in rank order:

```markdown
### <n>. <Name> — <score> (<band>)

**Auth <n> / Comp <n> / Adopt <n> / Maint <n> / Fit <n>**
<one line: what it is good at, and the one thing it does not cover>

- **Source:** <url> · **Author:** <who> · **Verified:** <timestamp>
- **Install:** `/plugin install <name>@<marketplace>` — or the actual path if not marketplace-listed
- **Contents:** <SKILL.md size, reference tree, scripts, commands, agents>
- **Flags:** <supply-chain flags with one line of context, or none>
- **Mirrors:** <count, if vendored elsewhere>
```

Keep to ~8 lines. This section is scannable reference, not prose.

### 5. Gap analysis and build recommendations

The section that most often justifies the run.

For every **Partial**, **Adjacent**, or **Uncovered** facet:

```markdown
### <facet> — <classification>

<one or two sentences on what exists and why it falls short>

**Build it yourself:**
- **Suggested name:** `<slug>`
- **Draft description:** `<a real description: line, trigger-rich>`
- **References it would need:** <list>
- **Closest thing to fork:** <url, or "nothing close">
```

Draft a real `description:` — the trigger phrasing is the hardest part of authoring a skill and the
most useful thing to hand over.

### 6. Also found — below threshold

Everything verified but scoring under `min_score`. Compact table, one line of why each was excluded.
Documents that they were evaluated rather than missed.

### 7. Unverified

Only when `include_unverified` is true. Claim, source of claim, what was attempted, why it failed.
Never formatted to resemble §2.

### 8. Method and coverage

Sources worked, query count, what was **not** searched and why. If the depth budget was hit before
all facets were covered, say which facets were left and what queries remain unrun.

## Excel workbook

Emit `.xlsx` when `xlsx` is in `outputs`. **Four sheets.**

### Sheet 1 — `Catalog`

One row per verified entry. Freeze the header row, autofilter on, columns sized to content.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| Rank | |
| Name | |
| Type | Skill · Plugin · Marketplace · Skill Pack |
| Category | Top-level facet |
| Subcategory | Specific facet |
| Score | 0–100 |
| Band | Essential · Recommended · Situational · Marginal |
| Authority Score | 0–30 |
| Comprehensiveness Score | 0–25 |
| Adoption Score | 0–20 |
| Maintenance Score | 0–15 |
| Fit Score | 0–10 |
| Authority Tier | Named band |
| Author / Org | |
| Upstream Repo URL | The canonical source, not the mirror |
| Skill Path | Path within the repo |
| Marketplace | Where listed, or blank |
| Install Command | Exact command |
| Homepage | |
| License | |
| Stars | Blank if not fetched — never guessed |
| Installs | Blank if not fetched |
| Last Updated | ISO date |
| Freshness | Current · Aging · Stale · Archived |
| SKILL.md Lines | Rough size |
| Has References | Y/N |
| Has Scripts | Y/N |
| Has Commands | Y/N |
| Has Agents | Y/N |
| Bundles MCP | Y/N |
| Bundles Hooks | Y/N |
| Pinned SHA | Y/N |
| Risk Flags | Comma-separated |
| Mirror Count | |
| Strength | One line |
| Limitation | One line — the thing it does not cover |
| Verified | Y/N |
| Verified At | Timestamp |

### Sheet 2 — `Gaps`

| Facet | Category | Coverage | Best Existing | Best Score | Suggested Skill Name | Draft Description | Fork Candidate |

One row per facet, including covered ones — a complete picture is more useful than a filtered one.

### Sheet 3 — `Sources`

| Source | Type | URL | Queried At | Results Found | Results Verified | Notes |

**Include queries that returned nothing.** Null results are evidence for the gap analysis and are
what make a repeat run comparable.

### Sheet 4 — `Run Log`

Key–value: topic, resolved arguments, `as_of`, tool-call count, elapsed, candidates found, verified,
dropped with reasons grouped, unverified count, budget hit Y/N, and any drift noticed in
`discovery-sources.md` (renamed registries, moved repos, dead aggregators).

The Run Log is what makes this skill reusable across topics — it lets a later run tell "the
ecosystem changed" apart from "the search was shallower this time".

## Conventions

- **Empty cells over guesses.** A blank `Stars` is honest; a fabricated one poisons every other cell.
- **ISO dates** throughout (`2026-08-11`).
- **Upstream URLs**, not aggregator listing pages, in `Upstream Repo URL`.
- **Exact install commands** — copy-pasteable, not paraphrased.
- Filenames: `skill-research-<topic-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` / `.xlsx`.

## JSON output

When `json` is in `outputs`, emit `Catalog` and `Gaps` as a single JSON document with the same field
names in `snake_case`, plus a `run` object mirroring the Run Log. For piping into other tooling.

## Install output

When `install` is in `outputs`, append a fenced block of the exact commands for every entry scoring
≥ `min_score`, ordered by rank, with marketplace-add lines first and de-duplicated:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>
/plugin install <name>@<marketplace>
```

Commands only — no commentary inside the block, so it can be pasted wholesale.
